# factoralizeNum
Return the factorial of the provided integer.

If the integer is represented with the letter n, a factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

Factorials are often represented with the shorthand notation n!

For example: 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120

Only integers greater than or equal to zero will be supplied to the function.


#SOLUTION

Using a for-loop will iterate through each element.
[initialize] [condition] [expression]

declaring a variable and set it to 1 because if any number multiple by 0 would be 0

as the for-loop iterates, it'll take the new number and multiple by the new number.
